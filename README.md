The Prisoner’s Dilemma was one of the early algorithmic problems in game theory, first posed in 1950. 
  In the Prisoner’s Dilemma, you and a partner have committed a crime together, and you are caught without evidence. 
    The police question you and your partner separately. 
•	If both of you collude together and refuse to talk the police, you both will go free. 
•	If you both confess your crime and betray each other, the liability of the crime will be split between you. 
    You both will receive the standard punishment.
•	If you stonewall the police, hoping to collude with your partner but your partner betrays you, you will 
    receive an unusually severe punishment while they go free and get to keep the stolen goods.
•	If you betray your partner while they attempt to collude with you, you will receive the cash and freedom.
